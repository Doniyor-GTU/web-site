# web-site
<h2>Web site of my high school</h2>

<p>I made this web-site when I was at last grade of  highschool. I downloaded a template of web-pages then changed its code, 
added some images, then put it on the internet. That times I wasn't able to write  CSS and JavaScript codes and could not 
learn them because of internet connection problems on my country.</p>
